# English-PFE-Report-Template
This document contains the Latex template of my end-of-study internship report. It was based on the template of [achreffaidi](https://github.com/achreffaidi/PFE-Skeleton).

## Structure

In the root folder there's a file called Report.tex. It's used to reference all the other documents on the \pages and \chapters directories.

\images contains images used in the project.

\chapters contains the latex code for each chapter.

\pages contains the complementary sections of the report.

references.bib and webography.bib contains the citations referenced in the report.

I used Overleaf to write this template. When you import this project, it should normally display only one warning.

You can modify FrontPage.docx and AbstractPage.docx then save them as .pdf files and include them in the overleaf project.
